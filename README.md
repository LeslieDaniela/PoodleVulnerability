# PoodleVulnerability

**Description:** For educational purposes only, 

### Backround:
The SSL protocol is used to encrypt data between a client and a web server who are communicating.
During the encryption process a key is used to encrypt plain text and convert it into a ciphertext, if done successful the integrity of the data is kept.

### Poodle Vulnerability:
The Poodle Vulnerability allows a third party (malicious entity) to decrypt some of the SLL traffic going from the client to the web server compromising data integrity. If this occurs the attacker can gather enough data to access the victims accounts. The entity referred to as a third party, or malicious entity, is also known as the man-in-the-middle exploit.

### SSLv3 Encryption/Decryption: 
When the client is communicating with a web server (ex. log in credentials) the data traveling is encrypted by a Message Authentication Code (MAC) that tags that data to ensure it came from the original sender. In addition, the SSLv3 uses padding to fill random bytes within the data traveling and the last byte is equal to the length of the padding.
If a third party compromises the data, the MAC would be compromised as well. If the MAC alerts that the data has been compromised, the client and web server drop the connection to ensure data integrity, but due to the encryption pattern of the SSL protocol the data might be compromised, and the MAC tag might not catch it. 

### Existing Issue:
The reason why the Poodle Vulnerability remains an issue despite being an old version is due to backwards compatibility. Most modern web servers and web browsers still support SSLv3 to be compatible with old systems. 
A “handshake” occurs between two parties of a network (ex. Browser and Web Server) were they establish the details of the connection including what versions they both support. A middleman could trick both networks to believe that they only support SSLv3, opening the doors to unsuspecting victims.
